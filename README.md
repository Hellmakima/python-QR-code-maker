# python-QR-code-maker

## Overview
This project is a personal exploration into QR code generation in Python. While there are established libraries like `qrcode`, this project was born out of curiosity and a desire to understand the underlying mechanics.
If you really want to make a QR use please `qrcode` library.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by [Varitacium's QR code video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w5ebcowAJD8). I wanted to dive deeper into QR code creation and found that itâ€™s a lot more complex than it appears!

## Current Status
The code is still a work in progress and is currently incomplete. Feel free to explore and contribute!
